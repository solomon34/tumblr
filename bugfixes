- always check if code is rails, javascript, or html. 
ex. 
		<% @post.each do |post| %>  -correct
		<%= @post.each do |post| %> -incorrect 
		. the problem is a simple mistake when the equal sign means to show things on the page and I did not want that to happen. 

-  <%= favicon_link_tag 'favicon.ico' %> 
	<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Raleway:400,700' %>  

- stylesheets not properly linked in the application.html.erb file
	<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application' %>  
	 
- double code in the body of the application.html.erb file 
	.look for two <body> tags and two of the same code
